<h1>Breasts and Eggs by Mieko Kawakami: 4/10</h1>

<p>I know a lot of people who really loved this book so I'm sorry in advance. I'm kidding. You all suck for recommending me 
    this book because I could have used that money to buy a good book.  
    <br/>
    Honestly, writing wise, it was alright. The characterization was there, language was alright (not amazing but not terrible like
    nevernight iykyk). The first part of the novel, Breasts, was a solid 7/10. 
    <br/> But the next part of the book, Eggs, was 2/10 at best for me. 
    <br/> I realize this book is about womanhood and bodily autonomy, and its very title, 
    "Breasts and Eggs" is supposed to be ironic, challenging the idea that woman aren't reduced
    to their breasts and eggs. 
    <br/> But whatever its purpose was, it doesn't succeed in showing this in my opinion. The book seems 
    more like a justification for having kids -- that kids make lives meaningful, that this is the purpose
    of a woman's life, thus reducing them to their breasts and eggs. 
    <br/> It's funny because the book makes a lot of compelling arguments as to why you shouldn't have kids...
    But all the characters, specifically women, who do not want / have kids are portrayed 
    as pessimistic, scornful people. 
    <br/> I want to make it clear that I'm not personally against childbirth and I'm a sucker for 
    <b>good</b> books that address the beauty of birth and motherhood. This book just wasn't it for me though. 
    I know it was really critically acclaimed and I was really disappointed. 

    <br/>Overall, if this is feminist, so is Haruki Murakami. Fun fact, Murakami called this book 
    "breathtaking". Yeah I'm a murakami hater-- you will never see a single murakami review on this page 
    because there is no way I'll voluntarily read one of his books again.
