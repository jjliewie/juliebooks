<h1>Life for sale: 5/10</h1>
<img src="../images/lifeforsale.jpg" width="300px">
<p>A really fast read. If I didn't fall asleep I think I would have finished it in under an hour. 
    <br/>
    The Trial by Franz Kafka meets Haruki Murakami's Killing Commendatore meets 
    Sayaka Murata's Life Ceremony meets Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho? 
    But it wasn't anything special-- mid if you would call it that.
    Interesting plot but poor execution. The absurdity didn't add to the novel, 
    I just got bored and annoyed. 

    <br/>The ending also sucks ass.
