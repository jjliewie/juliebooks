<p>I couldn't finish this. That says enough.  
    <br/>
    It's so melodramatic, and not in an effective way. 
    And why is it so sexual. There is no reason why this book had to be as 
    sexual as it was. Ruined it for me. Also the language because it sounds like
    how I used to write back in fifth grade when I discovered thesaurus.com. 

    <br/>Frankly killed my brain cells.
