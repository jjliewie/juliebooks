<h1>The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides: 8/10</h1>

<p>Beautiful, haunting language.
    <br/>
    I definitely liked the first part of the book better. It was slightly boring towards the end but I still
    finished the novel in one sitting so take it as you will. 

    <br/>There's a manic-pixie element to the girls, which is extremely deliberate. Clementine from 
    Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind - esque? The girls are as humanized as they are mystified, and I thought that was
    really well done. 
    <br/> This book might be a little hard to understand. I've recommended this book to quite a few people, 
    and a lot of them told me they just didn't get the point and couldn't finish it. 
    <br/> To me, this book is basically the literal definition of quality literature. You're not supposed to completely understand the girls. 
    And that mystery isn't meant to be pretentious. Even if you don't like these type of plots, I'd recommend this book 
    to everyone to read it at least for the language. 
    <br/>I'm not going to lie, I didn't love this book as much as I loved the other books on this rating list. 
    But the language, descriptions, and the sheer word choices in this book are simply immaculate.
    Jeffrey Eugenides is one hell of a writer, and you just have to read one of his books.
