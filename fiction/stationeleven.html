<h1>Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel: 10/10</h1>
<img src="../images/stationeleven.jpg" width="300px">
<p>Easily one of my favorites books of all time. I love Emily St. John Mandel, and her language
    is absolutely beautiful. My #1 inspiration.
    <br/>
    The plot is interesting & the characters are three-dimensional and actually likeable. 
    They're flawed, but not to point that I fucking despise them. 

    <br/> "Survival is Insuffient."
    <br/>And this novel makes me believe that.
