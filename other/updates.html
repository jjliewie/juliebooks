    <h1>Updates</h1>
    <h3>July 6 2023</h3>
    <p>I was going to make a search bar but I'm way too lazy. It's been too long since I've made an actual
        pure css/html/js website. I can not do this. I want to go back to my love react js but the set up 
        is honestly so annoying and npm and external installations aren't working well on this ass-computer for some reason. 
        If you want to search for a book, use command/control f!!! <33
